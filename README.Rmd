## Overview

> And though she be but little, she is fierce. - Shakespeare, on receiving

The goal of `edgyR` is to provide utilities for using R on NVIDIA
Jetson development kits. The Jetson kits include a complete NVIDIA
Docker runtime, and `edgyR` provides `bash` scripts that create a
Docker image with R and RStudio Server built from source. The image
takes a fair amount of time to build, even on an 8-core Xavier AGX. So
a copy of it is pushed to Docker Hub for downloading at the end of
the build process.

The base image for the build is <https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:l4t-base>.
The operating system in the Jetson kits and on the image is
[L4T](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/l4t/index.html), Ubuntu
`Bionic` for the `arm64` processor with numerous NVIDIA packages
added, including CUDA 10.2 and libraries to use the GPU on a Jetson
development kit.

Future versions of `edgyR` will have functions for installing and
accessing more GPU functionality, including both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
The target market for the Jetson product line is autonomous vehicles,
and NVIDIA provides a wealth of computer vision / deep learning
inference software for the boards. See
[NVIDIA NGC L4T containers](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers?orderBy=modifiedDESC&pageNumber=0&query=l4t&quickFilter=containers&filters=)
for a catalog of Docker images that will run on the Jetson.

## Installation

You can install `edgyR` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/znmeb/edgyR) with:

``` r
remotes::install_packages_github("znmeb/edgyR")
```

You can install this package on any system but the image build, run and push
scripts will only run on a Jetson L4T Tegra platform. I regularly test on a
Jetson Nano and a Jetson Xavier AGX and I expect they will also run on the
new Jetson Xavier NX.
