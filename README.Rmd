# edgyR

The goal of `edgyR` is to provide utilities for using R on NVIDIA Jetson
development kits. The current `edgyR` provides `bash` scripts that create a
Docker image for using R and RStudio Server. Later releases will include
functions for accessing the Jetson GPUs, including both TensorFlow and
PyTorch.

## Installation

You can install `edgyR` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/znmeb/edgyR) with:

``` r
remotes::install_packages_github("znmeb/edgyR")
```

Note that this software only runs on Jetson Nano and Xavier developer kits. It
will not run on a "convetional" `x86_64` machine. The Docker image this
package creates is currently available on Docker hub.
