See `vignette("dd-guide-to-the-edgyr-images")` for the list of images. In the
following, I'm going to describe using the largest image, `edgyr-ml`.

1. Open a terminal on the Jetson host machine. You can either do this from a
terminal window at the host console or logged in remotely via secure shell
(SSH).
2. Create a `Projects` directory and clone this repository into it.

    ```
    mkdir --parents Projects
    cd Projects
    git clone https://github.com/znmeb/edgyR.git
    cd edgyR/container-run-scripts
    ```

3. Download the images: `./pull-edgyr-images`. You will need to enter your
Jetson password to run `sudo`.
4. Define a new password for the `edgyr` account in the container. For
security reasons, the container will exit if you do not do this. The new
password must be at least 12 characters long. Set the new password in the
environment variable `EDGYR_PASSWORD`. For example:

    `export EDGYR_PASSWORD="12.angry%characters"`
5. Start the container with `./run-ml`. You may have to enter your Jetson
password for `sudo` again.

    RStudio Server will start, listening on IP address `0.0.0.0` port `8787.
    You should see
    
    ```
    ./run-ml 
    Force-removing old 'edgyr' container
    You can ignore errors if it doesn't exist
    Error: No such container: edgyr

    Resetting 'edgyr' password
    Starting RStudio Server - browse to port 8787 on Docker host
    ```
    
    The long hexadecimal string will be different on your system, but the rest
    should look like what's above.
    
6. Browse to the server and log in. On the Jetson console, browse to
`localhost:8787`. On a remote system, browse to port `8787` on the IP address
of the Jetson host. 

    For example, my Jetson Nano has IP address `192.168.254.23`, so I browse
    to `http://192.168.254.23:8787`. The user name is `edgyr` and the password
    is the one you defined in step 3.
